======
STAERT is a lightweight, cross-browser, self-hosted "start page" solution in the spirit of [MyFav.es](https://www.myfav.es/) or [Symbaloo](http://www.symbaloo.com/).

Motivation
----------
I wanted to create a very simple browser start page that was always in sync, across all of the browsers I use. And I use a lot of different browsers between work, home, tablets and phone. I tried various services but felt they were either too feature-rich or too limited, and all of them require an account.

Installation
------------
[Download](https://github.com/OttoHagg/staert/archive/master.zip) and extract STAERT to some local directory. Using your favorite text editor, open index.html and edit the "favorites" JavaScript array.

### Local Installation
Set your customized index.html file to be your homepage in your browser. 

### Web Host Installation
Upload your customized STAERT files to your web host and set index.html to be your homepage.

### Dropbox Installation
This is the way I use STAERT, and it assumes you've installed [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) on all the devices you use. Simply move your STAERT install to your dropbox folder and follow the instructions for "Local Installation". Whenever you add/remove favorites the changes are sync'd across all your devices.

Tips
----
* Firefox users can install the [New Tab Homepage](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-homepage/) extension to get STAERT on each new tab.

Credits
-------
* STAERT is loosely inspired by [Launchbot](http://launchbot.michaelxander.com/) and borrows a little code.
* STAERT is responsive thanks to [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com).
